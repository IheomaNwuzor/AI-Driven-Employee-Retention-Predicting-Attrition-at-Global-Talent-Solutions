# Background
■	Global Talent Solutions (GTS) is a multinational company specializing in providing comprehensive HR solutions, including talent acquisition, employee training, and workforce analytics. 
■	With over 10,000 employees spread across 25 countries, GTS serves a diverse clientele ranging from Fortune 500 companies to small and medium enterprises. 
■	GTS prides itself on fostering workplace innovation and leveraging data-driven insights to support its clients' HR strategies.
Mission: To empower businesses through innovative and data-driven human resource solutions.
Vision: To be the global leader in human capital management, transforming workplace cultures through analytics and empathy.

# Problem Statement
■	GTS has noticed an alarming trend of employee turnover within its own workforce. 
✓	Over the past year, the company recorded a 20% attrition rate, significantly higher than the industry average of 12%. 	
✓	High employee turnover disrupts operations, increases recruitment costs, and negatively impacts client satisfaction. 
■	GTS wants to identify factors influencing employee attrition and predict which employees are most likely to leave. This will enable the HR team to implement targeted retention strategies.

# Rationale
Employee attrition is costly and disruptive, particularly for a company like GTS, whose reputation depends on delivering world-class HR services. Understanding and predicting employee attrition will:
1.	Reduce Costs: Minimize the expenses related to hiring and onboarding replacements.
2.	Improve Workforce Stability: Retain experienced employees who are critical to client success.
3.	Enhance Client Satisfaction: Ensure continuity in service delivery.
4.	Support Data-Driven Decisions: Empower the HR team with actionable insights to improve workplace policies.

# Project Aim:
To develop a data-driven predictive framework using machine learning techniques to identify employees at risk of attrition and provide actionable insights for targeted retention strategies, enhancing workforce stability, reducing operational costs, and improving organisational performance at GTS.

# Project Objectives:
1.	Data Integration & Preprocessing: Collect and consolidate HR data from multiple sources, including demographics, performance metrics, engagement surveys, and training records, ensuring data quality and consistency.
2.	Pattern Discovery & Analysis: Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify key factors influencing employee turnover.
3.	Predictive Modeling: Develop and optimize machine learning models to accurately predict employee attrition, balancing performance with interpretability.
4.	Insight Generation: Use explainable AI techniques (e.g., SHAP) to determine the most critical drivers of attrition and generate actionable recommendations for HR decision-making.
5.	Implementation & Monitoring: Integrate the predictive system into a real-time dashboard for continuous monitoring, enabling proactive interventions and measurable reduction in attrition.
6.	Evaluation of Impact: Assess the effectiveness of predictive insights on workforce retention, operational costs, and employee engagement metrics.
